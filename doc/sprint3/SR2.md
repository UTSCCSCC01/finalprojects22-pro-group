# SR2.md - Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

## Meeting Detail:

-   On July 7th (Thursday) at 21:00, we had our Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting on zoom meeting
-   All team members (six people: Junheng Wang, Zhitao Xu, Qi Li, Xiangyi Li, Zijian Fan, Yuanhan Chen) attend, and everyone participates in the discussion

## Unfinished tasks

-   None

## Practices that you should continue

-   We had standup meetings on time and everyone attended every standup meeting
-   We planned together and went over the handout and the rubric together in the meeting
-   Everyone is positive and willing to participate
-   We have tidy branches to track user stories

## Some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint

-   We can have more explained comments to help others to understand the code when developing the project.
-   We need to help each other when someone faces problems.
-   Backend and Frontend can communicate more to avoid unclear instructions.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint

-   We should finish the assigned task on time (before the stand-up meeting) to ensure no delay with the plan.
-   Git message doesnâ€™t follow the requirement, we should have standard git messages during this sprint

## Best/worst experience during sprint 2

-   the best experience is we reformat the structure to help future user story implementation
-   the worst experience is dealing with the display flex css which is hard to make sure the page looks like what we want
