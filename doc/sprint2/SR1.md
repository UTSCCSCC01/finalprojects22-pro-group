# SR1.md - Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

## Meeting Detail:

-   On June 21st (Tuesday) at 18:30, we had our Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting on zoom meeting
-   All team members (six people: Junheng Wang, Zhitao Xu, Qi Li, Xiangyi Li, Zijian Fan, Yuanhan Chen) attend, and everyone participates in the discussion

## Unfinished tasks

-   None

## Practices that you should continue

-   We had standup meetings on time and everyone attended every standup meeting
-   We planned together and went over the handout and the rubric together in the meeting
-   Everyone is positive and willing to participate

## Some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint

-   We can have more tidy git branches (use user stories as git branch).
-   We can have more comments to help others to understand the code when developing the project.
-   We need to help each other when someone faces problems.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint

-   Not so good communication, we should communicate better during this sprint.
-   Git message doesn't follow the requirement, we should have standard git messages during this sprint

## Best/worst experience during sprint 1

-   the best experience is we connect all parts of the subtasks and user stories and have a basic stock website at the end of sprint 1.
-   the worst experience is learning the corresponding techniques since we don't have enough time to study from the basics we need to study from projects and it's not so clear compare to learning everything.
-   Another very bad experience is fixing the CORS error.
