﻿● Reflect on how your team worked together.

Overall the team worked together well. Everyone did their job and we got all our tasks done on

time. In total we met 3 times collectively in person and 3 times collectively online, and we kept in

touch on Discord. We made sure to do our own share of the work on time and made sure to ask

the TA and each other for help whenever we needed anything that was unknown.

● How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

We organized the team around time of availability to know when to meet. We also made sure to

meet regularly and we evenly distributed the tasks. Each person either chose their task, or they

worked on a feature that was assigned to them. Team organized based on their tasks.

Tools: jira, github, calendar, Discord

● How did you make decisions?

We voted and see who wants to do what. Otherwise if it was a draw, we discussed it further,

eliminated the options and chose something that everyone was agreeing with. We decided to

make something that was difficult and something that was challenging and impressive but would

not be too hard or impossible to create.

● How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on

average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

Points were based on an estimate on how long it would take to build something. Rounds of

Voting was 1, but sometimes if it was necessary we will make it 2 to come to a consensus on

the point estimate.

● How frequently did you meet?

Once a day. If there are tasks that need to be done we will message frequently online.

● What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

We need to more discussion around the tasks and how each of us have completed it or not.

Other than that we were able to do more complex problems that none of us couldve done on our

own than they could on their own. We need to know how to Delegate roles and responsibilities

effectively, so that nobody feels they are doing too much or too little. We need to be willing to

speak up and share our perspectives. We need to pool together our knowledge and skills and

also Hold each other accountable in case one of us goes missing. Many people didn’t contribute

as much so we needed to speak out on it.
