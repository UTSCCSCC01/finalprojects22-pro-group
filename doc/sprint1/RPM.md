+ All team members (six people: Junheng Wang, Zhitao Xu, Qi Li, Xiangyi Li, Zijian Fan, Yuanhan Chen) attend, and everyone participates in the discussion
 
## Release Goal
+ Our release goal is to build a stock website where any user can see stock statistics, search stocks they would like to view and analyze the stock on the website. The website will have a discussion feature that allows users to communicate and connect with each other. In this way, users can have more references to make their decision. 
+ Also, the website will be user-friendly and responsive so that users can use it easily. Also, the web page should look visually appealing and professional when users want to use this application.
+ Past and current information about stocks such as prices and charts are important for investors to make decisions. So to support our goal of providing users with an application that has almost all of their stock-related needs, our application will have a market section that displays up-to-date as well as historical information about different stocks.
