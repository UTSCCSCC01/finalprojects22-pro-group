# SR3.md - Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting 
## Meeting Detail: 
+	On July 21st (Thursday) at 21:20, we had our Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting on zoom meeting
+	All team members (six people: Junheng Wang, Zhitao Xu, Qi Li, Xiangyi Li, Zijian Fan, Yuanhan Chen) attend, and everyone participates in the discussion

## Unfinished tasks
+	None

## Practices that you should continue
+	We had standup meetings on time and everyone attended every standup meeting
+	We planned together and went over the handout and the rubric together in the meeting
+	Everyone is positive and willing to participate
+	We have tidy branches to track user stories
+	We have a good file structure so the merge step is really simple

##  Some new practices that you might want to use during the next sprint
+	We can have more explained comments to help others to understand the code when developing the project.
+	We need to help each other when someone faces problems.
+	We need to clearly know about the CoS to help avoid misunderstanding the user story.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint
+	We should finish the assigned task on time (before the stand-up meeting) to ensure no delay with the plan.
+	Some team members code at midnight which lead to a lack of communication, we should do programming earlier other than midnight.

## Best/worst experience during sprint 3
+	the best experience is we are fluent with css and get the page looks good and we fix the bug with API send 429.
+	the worst experience is we worked until the last minutes of the sprint which may led to delays in the work.
