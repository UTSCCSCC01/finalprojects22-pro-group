## Technology Used

### React

-   We are using IEX API with useState and useEffect React hooks.
-   For useState:

```
  const [stockChartXValues, setStockChartXValues] = useState([]);
  const [stockChartYValues, setStockChartYValues] = useState([]);
```

-   These are used to store the state of the X and Y coordinates as arrays.
-   We are using APIs to get the historical trend data.
-   We are also using the use Effect to get the react stock to fetch once.

```
  useEffect(() => {
    getStockRequest(StockSymbol);
  }, []);
```

-   For the web page constraint, we used a html table to ensure equal to or more than two stocksâ€™s line chart can be seen parallel:

```
<table><tr>
	<td>stock_1</td>
	<td>stock_2</td>
	<td>stock_n</td>
</tr></table>
```

### MDUI

-   We use the MDUI library to build some basic components in the interface such as navigation bar, edit text and button.
-   To install MDUI, enter npm install mdui --save in the shell. ( visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mduii for the detailed guidance)
