# Motivation

**The motivation of this idea is to build a stock trading website with majority features for traders to analyze and make decisions, a friend system is included as well, so that traders can share their decision with their friends efficiently.**

# Installation

The web application is made using [react](https://reactjs.org/), so the prerequisite are to have both [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. To build the project:

```
# install create-react-app:
npm i -g create-react-app
# cd into the root directory of the project
create-react-app react-app
cd react-app/
# run app:
npm start
```

# Contribution

We use the git-flow workflow for merging and managing code in the repository. The name of the branches as per git flow are

1. ÃŸmain
2. hotfix
3. release
4. develop
5. feature

The features branches follow the following naming convention of _feature\_{name_of_feature_separated_by_underscores}_. We use Jira for tracking issues and to merge a feature branch into the develop branch requires a pull request that needs to be approved by atleast 2 group members.
