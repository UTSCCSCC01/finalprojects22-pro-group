# Motivation

**The motivation of this idea is to build a stock trading website with majority features for traders to analyze and make decisions, a friend system is included as well, so that traders can share their decision with their friends efficiently.**

# Installation

The web application is made using [react](https://reactjs.org/), so the prerequisite are to have both [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Nodejs and npm can be installed together at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To build the project:

```
# run install in each directory: backend/ and frontend/ 
# run command:
npm install

# to run back end: cd into the backend directory of the project
# run command:
npm start

# to run front end: cd into the frontend directory of the project
# run command:
npm start
# if the system ask you to change port, type yes

# open http://localhost:3001/ in the browser to see the website
```

# Contribution

We use the git-flow workflow for merging and managing code in the repository. The name of the branches as per git flow are

1. SPRINT_1
2. SPRINT_2
3. SPRINT_3
4. SPRINT_4

The features branches follow the following naming convention of PROG-X (X is the ticket number). 
We will use Jira for tracking issues and to merge a feature branch into the develop branch requires a pull request that needs to be approved by at least 2 group members to merge into main branch.
