# Motivation

**The motivation of this idea is to build a stock trading website with majority features for traders to analyze and make decisions, a friend system is included as well, so that traders can share their decision with their friends efficiently.**

# Installation

The web application is made using [react](https://reactjs.org/), so the prerequisite are to have both [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Nodejs and npm can be installed together at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To build the project:

```
# run install in each directory: backend/ and frontend/
# run command:
npm install

# to run back end: cd into the backend directory of the project
# run command:
npm start

# to run front end: cd into the frontend directory of the project
# run command:
npm start
# if the system ask you to change port, type yes

# open http://localhost:3000/ in the browser to see the website
```

# Contribution

-   We use the git-flow workflow for merging and managing code in the repository. The name of the branches as per git flow are

1. Sprint_1_Develop_Branch
2. Sprint_2_Develop_Branch
3. Sprint_3_Develop_Branch
4. Sprint_4_Develop_Branch

-   The features branches follow the following naming convention of PROG-X (X is the ticket number).
-   We will use SPRINT_X_Merge to merge all user stories together
-   We will use Jira for tracking issues and to merge a feature branch into the develop branch requires a pull request that needs to be approved by at least 2 group members to merge into main branch.
